## Description
This application was to build a Text Editor with the Progressive Web Applications(PWA). We used a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case is not supported by the brower, and the application can function offline. It is useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
